## Overview

First, install `create-hyperweb-app` globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g create-hyperweb-app
```

Then, create your new Cosmos app by running the following command:

```sh
# you can also use `cha` instead of `create-hyperweb-app` for shortcut ;)
create-hyperweb-app
```

During the setup process, you'll be prompted to enter the name of your app. For example:

```plaintext
> name: my-app
```

**Note:** You must have an SSH key added to your GitHub account to complete the setup process. For instructions on how to generate and add an SSH key, please refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

Once the app is created, move into the app directory and start the development server:

```sh
cd my-app
yarn && yarn dev
```

Now your app should be running on `http://localhost:3000`!
