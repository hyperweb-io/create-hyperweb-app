## Overview

First, install `create-hyperweb-app` globally using npm:

```sh
npm install -g create-hyperweb-app
```

Then, create your new Cosmos app by running the following command:

```sh
# you can also use `cha` instead of `create-hyperweb-app` for shortcut ;)
create-hyperweb-app
```

During the setup process, you'll be prompted to enter the name of your app. For example:

```plaintext
> name: my-app
```

**Note:** You must have an SSH key added to your GitHub account to complete the setup process. For instructions on how to generate and add an SSH key, please refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

Once the app is created, move into the app directory and start the development server:

```sh
cd my-app
yarn && yarn dev
```

Now your app should be running on `http://localhost:3000`!

### Get Started Immediately

You don't need to install or configure cosmjs, keplr, nextjs, webpack or Babel.

Everything is preconfigured, ready-to-go, so you can focus on your code!

## Creating an App

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### global install

```sh
npm install -g create-hyperweb-app
```

Then run the command:

```sh
create-hyperweb-app
```

we also made an alias `cha` if you don't want to type `create-hyperweb-app`:

```sh
cha
```

### npx

```sh
npx create-hyperweb-app
```

### npm

```sh
npm init hyperweb-app
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn create hyperweb-app
```

## Templates

The `create-hyperweb-app` tool provides carefully crafted templates to help you understand and test various features and integrations. By executing the templates, you can quickly see how to implement specific functionalities in your Cosmos app.

```
cha --template
```

If you know the template name, you can do

```
cha --template <template-name>
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand `-t` flag to achieve the same:

```
cha -t <template-name>
```

This command will generate a new project configured with the selected template, allowing you to dive into the code and functionality right away.

### Hyperweb

</p>

Facilitate the development of decentralized applications by enabling developers to write and compile TypeScript smart contracts locally.

```
cha --name hyperweb-template --template hyperweb
```

### Chain Admin

Manage and integrate multiple modules such as staking, voting and asset-list within your application. This template provides a comprehensive setup for building robust and feature-rich Cosmos apps.

```
cha --name chain-admin-template --template chain-admin
```
